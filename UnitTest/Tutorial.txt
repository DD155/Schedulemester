How to simulate firebase using Firebase Emulator:

First: make sure you have all the neccesary packages installed. 
This includes:
npm install mocha --save-dev
npm install @firebase/testing --save-dev

Second: Ensure you have two terminals avaiable to run.
One will be running the simulator while the other allows you to run tests.

On Both terminals ensure you are in the \schedulemester\unittest\ directory.

Third: type in firebase emulators:start 

NOTE* You may need to login to firebase through the terminal.
You can do this by writing: Firebase login, and follow the prompts to login.*

After you have logged in and see that the emulator has started,

You can head over to the other terminal and do npm test like we usually do with jest. 
It follows the same protocol like the unit testing we usually do.
